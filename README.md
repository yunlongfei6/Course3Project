# Course3Project
 The README.md in the repo is to describe how the script works and the code book describing the variables.
 
 The code in the run.analysis.R can be used to reproduce the final dataset step-by-step as followed:
 1) Check/set the working directory for the project.
 2) Download and unzip the data sets for the project.
 3) Read datasets features and activity_labels into R
 4) Read training datasets into R
 5) Read test datasets into R
 6) Merge training and test datasets to create one dataset
 7) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
 8) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 9) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
 10) The final dataset was saved and uploaded as insructed.
